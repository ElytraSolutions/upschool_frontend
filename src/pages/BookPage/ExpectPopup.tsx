                                When you purchase a digital copy of a book from
                                the Upschool Library, it will be supplied to you
                                in a PDF format.

                                When an order is placed, we review the book file
                                to ensure it meets our printing criteria. Should
                                the text be in the wrong position (for example,
                                too close to a margin) or there is some other
                                issue present, we will either:

                                    Contact the author requesting them to make
                                    changes to their book file and have them
                                    re-upload it, so we can arrange printing,
                                    or;
                                </li>

                                    We will edit the book on behalf of the
                                    author so that it complies with our printing
                                    requirements.
                                </li>

                                Should edits to a book be necessary, this will
                                result in a delay to production and shipping. We
                                ask for your patience should this occur.

                                If the book does not require editing, we will
                                endeavour to arrange printing and shipping at
                                the soonest opportunity.
